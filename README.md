# OpenOrdex - Open Ordinals Decentralized Exchange

OpenOrdex is an open source zero-fee trustless Bitcoin NFT marketplace based on partially signed bitcoin transactions

## How it works
The seller creates a partially signed bitcoin transaction (PSBT) specifying the price of the ordinal.  
The buyer can then sign the PSBT and broadcast it to the network.

## How to add your collection
All inscriptions can be viewed directly via their inscription number or ID.

In addition, the homepage features collections in a random order.  
The collection data is taken from the [ordinal-collections](https://github.com/ordinals-wallet/ordinals-collections) repo.  

In order to have your collection listed, create a pull request on the [ordinal-collections](https://github.com/ordinals-wallet/ordinals-collections) repo.
