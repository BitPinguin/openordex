Instructions to upload your metadata and assets to NiftyKit


// Uploading Assets Only (No Metadata)

* Please name your assets in sequential order, such as 1.png, 2.png, 3.png, etc.

* If you only upload asset files and no metadata exists, we will create the tokens with placeholder metadata.


// Uploading Metadata

* You may also upload a CSV or JSON file containing your NFT's metadata. The metadata should include the following fields: name, image, description, animation_url, background_color, youtube_url, external_url, and attributes[Name] columns.

* Please note that the image, animation_url, background_color, youtube_url, and external_url fields are optional.

* If you include an image field in your CSV or JSON file, it will override any previously uploaded images for that specific NFT.

* If you upload both image files and metadata exists, we will update only the images. For example, if you have already uploaded ten tokens and upload image 5.png, we will update the image for token #5.

* If you upload a CSV or JSON with an image field, it will override any previously uploaded image.
